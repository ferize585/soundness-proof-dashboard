Soundness Proof Highlight is a live rotation spotlight across the Soundness Layer â€” where each role syncs, verifies, and contributes to the networkâ€™s proof integrity.

Roles move in sequence (WAVA, BLU, BLOOP, ZIPPY, ECHO),
each carrying a pulse that keeps the layer stable and sound.

âš¡ Live Cycle

ðŸŒ€ Active Today: ECHO

ðŸ•“ Status: Proofstream running

â›“ Sync: Stable across layer

ðŸ’  Next Rotation: ZIPPY

ðŸ§  Concept

Soundness is more than verification â€”
itâ€™s a continuous sync between precision and trust.
Each proof adds resonance to the layer,
each role completes the chain.

âœ¨ Personal Note

iâ€™m synced with the layer â€”
not chasing the spotlight,
just keeping the flow steady.
